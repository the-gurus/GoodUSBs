### [+] Description
A collection of **Good**-*BadUSB* scripts. When I got out of school for **Cyber Sec**, I realized how *hard* it was to get a job with *no experience*, so I started **freelancing**. *Long story short*, I had a plethora of **Hak5** tools and realized they had *amazing potential* to automate some of the daily tasks I have as an **I.T. Consultant**. We wanted to store them here so you too can contribute to the **"GoodUSBs"** repo!
